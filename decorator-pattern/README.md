# Introduction
This section is about the **Decorator Pattern** from https://medium.com/@josueparra2892/decorator-pattern-in-go-ef9a4cc6020e. 

This pattern belongs to the structural domain of design patterns. A structural pattern, as the name indicates, is telling us that this sort of pattern falls within the *building* domain.

Decorator pattern adds new behaviour to existing objects by replacing them inside special wrapper objects.

# Key takeaways
This is similar to composite pattern whereby is building/ extending upon something that exist.

However, composite is a compilation of a bunch of child components under one parents, whereas decorator is a single child.
