# Introduction
SOLID principle is a nice and simple principle to follow when writing OOP codes.

# Key takeaways
## S: Single Responsibility Principle
A module should have one and only one reason to change.

## O: Open/ Closed Principle
A software artifact should be open for extension but closed for modifications

## L: Liskov Substitution Princple 
Extends the Open/Closed principle and enables you to replace objects of a parent class with objects of a subclass without breaking the application.

## I: Interface Segregation
Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they don't use

## D: Dependency Inversion
High level modules should not depend on low level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
